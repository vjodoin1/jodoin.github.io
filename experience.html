        <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
        <p>My passion for education comes from having been a homeschooler during most of my secondary education. Learning for me incorporated manipulatives, active discussion, and open ended questions rather than lecture style learning. This is a core foundation that I have kept with me throughout my own educational career as well as my teaching career. That is why I opt to ensure my students are engaged in every lesson while being provided a low floor and a high ceiling. This ensures that all learning styles and students of all backgrounds can all feel like they are “math people” in my classroom.

                <h3>Math 125 | Basic Calculus</h3>
                <p>
                    Teaching basic calculus lets me support students in mastering mathematical reasoning and conceptual understanding. This course is crucial for students to develop the application of mathematics to real world problems. Making use of 3 Act Math and other resources to allow students to see where in their life there are problems with mathematical undertones.

                <h3>Math 119 | College Algebra</h3>
                <p>Teaching college algebra was a great opportunity to support students in mastering procedural fluency and problem solving skills. This course is crucial for students to develop the skills to solve higher level problems in future math class, as well as build core life skills of being able to solve real life problems with a mathematical undertone.

                <h3>Outreach | TAPPED-INTO STEM</h3>
                <p>
                    While working as an instructor for the Mathematics department I got to take part in the TAPDINTO-STEM program at UTK as a graduate mentor to 10 undergraduate students. This organization is intended for students with disabilities to have a support group and foster community on campus. We meet regularly to talk about how life on campus is, course work is going, and current barriers that we may be facing. I take this opportunity to help connect students to resources on campus as well as work with the faculty mentors to develop engagement events.
