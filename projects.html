        <p>
            My research explores the intersection of mathematics and public health as well as ecological models, focusing on bio-preparedness as well as infectious diseases for both humans and animals. I have presented my work at conferences such as the Math Association of America (Southeast Conference) and National Institute of Modeling Biological Systems and the Joint Math Meetings as well as publish in Mathematical Biosciences.

                <h3>Testosterone Levels vs Behaviors</h3>
                <p>The Chattanooga Zoo reached out for researches and collaborators. I was selected and was able to work with Anthony L. Ashley, DVM. of Chattanooga Zoo and Dr. Lenhart of UTK

                    During our work we investigated the correlation between giraffe pacing time and fecal testosterone levels using Pearson correlation and regression modeling, finding significant positive associations for two subjects.
                          
                    After working with the data I opted to apply linear regression models and utilized Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to determine optimal models, emphasizing simplicity and predictive power without additional factors.
                    
                    Near the end of the project I conducted hypothesis testing and evaluated model strength with RÂ² values, demonstrating robust analytical skills and an evidence-based approach to behavioral data interpretation.

                <h3>Population Health Surveillance</h3>
                <p>This work was supported by DOE and ORISE under the Education Collaboration Opportunity 2024, where I got to work under the supervision of Dr. Hanson

                    My first task had me performing literature review and data cleaning to build a robust analytic file for COVID-19 forecasting.
                    
                    During this project we employed modeling strategies to simulate in both spatial and aspatial scenarios, enabling data-driven decision-making for enhanced public health measures.
                    
                    I also took part in and led part of the weekly journal club where several researchers, scientists, and interns discussed interdisciplinary papers within the field of applied mathematics.

                <h3>Prescription Opioid Epidemic</h3>
                <p>This project was a continuation from an Undergraduate Summer Research project where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Lenhart and Dr. Strickland. 
                    I was able to continue this summer work in Dr. Stricklands Lab where I was able to conduct interdisciplinary research, demonstrating proficiency in data analysis. 
                    Our goal was to develop a novel Agent Based Model intended to show disease dynamics for the spread of opioid addiction across a social network. 
                    I also collaborated in compiling the findings into a manuscript to submit to the journal of Mathematical Biosciences.
